Add files upload step to edit view screen

need upload endpoint

need way to get link to file OR add files application that shows list of files
both?

When link is clicked, API checks permissions on file

Look at FileController.cs in VM API for file upload example

Need DB table for files - file name, view, teams, path/pointer to actual file

Files get sent to some volume in docker, actual path is abstracted as player/files or whatever

would be nice if URLs ended in filename
